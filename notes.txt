🐱 Face / Camera Cat Project — Learning Notes 



Project Overview

Built a small computer vision project using a camera feed to detect and track a cat’s face in real time. The project focused on applying basic computer vision concepts rather than model training.

What I Learned

How to access and process a live camera feed using OpenCV.

How face detection models work at a high level, including how pre-trained classifiers identify facial features.

The importance of lighting, camera angle, and movement for detection accuracy.

How detection can fail or behave unpredictably when objects move quickly or look similar.

How to draw bounding boxes and overlays on detected objects in real time.

The difference between detection and tracking, and why tracking can break when the initial detection isn’t strong.

Challenges I Ran Into

Detection accuracy dropped when the cat moved quickly or turned its head.

Similar shapes and colors caused inconsistent detection.

The model was sensitive to lighting changes and background noise.

Debugging live video felt harder than working with static images.

Key Takeaways

Pre-trained models are powerful but have clear limitations.

Real-world data is messy compared to examples in tutorials.

Computer vision requires a lot of iteration and visual debugging.

Small projects like this are a good way to understand CV concepts before moving on to more complex models.

What I’d Improve or Try Next

Experiment with different pre-trained detectors.

Improve detection stability using better lighting or camera positioning.

Try adding basic tracking logic to smooth detections.

Compare this approach to a deep-learning-based detector.
